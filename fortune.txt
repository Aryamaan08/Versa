You have a bright future ahead of you.
I see some problems a week or so ahead.
You will receive a great gift exactly one month from now.
There could be something wrong with a father figure (dad, uncle, grandpa etc.) in your family.
Someone in your family will have a heart condition.
You will learn an important life lesson less than a week from now.
Shut up, this is random. Why are you asking a fortune cookie? Go live your life yourself. There is no fate, only science.
I will not tell you today, come back tomorrow.
