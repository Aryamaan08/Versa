# Versa
## Fun and useful!

This is the official Github file for Versa#3702. You may use this code for your own bot, but please change something in the code. This is just for credibility that Versa can be trusted.

## Install guide
To use this file you need the following:
1) A Discord account
2) Python
3) Python added to path
4) Pip3

Step 1: Create a Discord application.
Go to discord.com/applications.
Create new applications.
Go to Bot, click add a bot.
Give it administrator (or send messages, read message history and embed links).
Go to OAuth2.
Click bot, then scroll down and select the permissions you selected earlier.
Copy the OAuth2 link and invite it to a server.
Go  back to Bot.
Click copy token.

Step 2: Install Discord.py
Search command prompt on Windows.
Enter "pip install discord.py".

Step 3: Download the code.
Click Download code, then click ZIP file. You can use git clone if you want.
I would recommend saving it to Desktop.

Step 4: Edit the files.
You can edit bot.py as needed.
Paste the token in token.txt (replace the text)
Empty the prefixes.json file.

Step 5: Run the bot.
Go to Command Prompt.
Change directory to the one where the bot code is.
If you saved it to Desktop,
cd Desktop/Versa-master should work.
Type python bot.py
If the message wasn't changed, it should now say Ready!
